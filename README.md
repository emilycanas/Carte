# Carte
Carte is an innovative digital menu and ordering platform designed with restaurants and improved customer experience in mind. Carte's platform bridges the gap between customer and restaurant owners with their dynamic menus that increased operation efficencies for restaurant operators.

While at Carte I have worked on the front-end and back-end funcationality of a feature that allows Carte users to input, update, and delete locations associated with their logged-in credentials. 

** Carte is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code sinppets of the location feature that I worked on. This repository contains MySQL, .NET, and React code for said feature.
