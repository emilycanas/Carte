# Carte
Carte is an innovative digital menu and ordering platform made for restaurants with improved customer experience in mind. Carte bridges the gap between customer and restaurant owners by providing a platform with dynamic menus that increased operation efficencies for restaurant operators

While at Carte I have:   
-Created a feature that allows Carte users to input, update, and delete locations associated with their credentials. 



Carte is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code sinppets of my code. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code for the Location Features.
